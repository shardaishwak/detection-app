# MemoryMatch

## Inspiration 💡

We all have that one cherished childhood photo that holds a special place in our hearts. It's a snapshot that we long to recreate, a moment frozen in time. With MemoryMatch, we aim to turn this dream into reality. Our app not only helps you reminisce about your favorite childhood memories but also guides you through the process of reliving those precious moments.

## What it does ❓


By leveraging real-time pose estimation technology, MemoryMatch compares your current position and the original photo.
1. **Real-Time Pose Comparison**: Upload a photo from your childhood or any meaningful moment: MemoryMatch understands the unique poses by weighing the position of each individual body part in the live image against the position of a corresponding still image body part.
2. **Guided Recreation**: Receive step-by-step guidelines to adjust your pose, ensuring a close match to the original photo.
3. **Share or save the photo**: Once you've successfully matched the pose, share the recreated memories and have them join the challenge! You can also create individual albums to revisit your moments at any time.
